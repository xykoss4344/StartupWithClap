# StartupWithClap

**Why?**
i did this cause i was bored. there is really no benefit of using it given that windows already have startup app stuff. maybe ill make it work for linux later.

**What it does**
it just does the simple stuff:
*   claps twice
*   says "wake up"
*   plays the ironman 2 music
*   opens all your tabs for you

**Things to do**
*   [ ] works with linux
*   [ ] start up the exe file way earlier so it more efficent
*   [ ] play animation with wa
